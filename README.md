allow2mac
=========

This is the first demo project for the Allow2 Service.

It is a time-control system for Apple Mac computers (Mac OSX, Leopard and above).

It provides a concrete example of how to perform a full-featured integration with the Allow2 service via the open-source allow2deviceAPI.

The intention, by outsourcing, is to:

1. Accelerate development,
2. Provide an example for integration into device firmware and other application software, and
3. To act as a base for porting to allow2linux and allow2windows (and any other systems as required).
